## TODO

### priority

- [ ] build personal message dataset and fine tune

### medium

- [x] Append messages rapidly sent to me in succession into a single message/API call

- [ ] Add name awareness (running into bug where `name:` is printed at end of message)

- [x] refine stop sequencing so it can stop a conversation

- [x] shouldn't respond to text message reactions

- [x] for each session, initialize a dictionary with the conversation thus far. Feed in this dictionary as a string into GPT each time, so that the bot is contextually aware. Hazard: ensure dictionary string size is below token limit (unlikely to exceed)

- [x] sentences delimited by period are sent as separate messages

- [x] shouldn't respond to when only an image is sent

### min

- [x] make terminal output pretty

- [ ] Add a way to send messages to groups. NOTE: either need to use webhook or add participants to REST API call. <https://github.com/ZekeSnider/Jared/issues/58>
