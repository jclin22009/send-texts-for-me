## TODO
### priority
- [ ] Add a way to send messages to groups. NOTE: either need to use webhook or add participants to REST API call. https://github.com/ZekeSnider/Jared/issues/58

- [ ] Add name awareness (running into bug where `name:` is printed at end of message)

- [ ] build personal message dataset and fine tune

### medium
- [ ] Append messages rapidly sent to me in succession into a single message/API call

- [ ] refine stop sequencing so it can stop a conversation

- [ ] shouldn't respond to text message reactions

- [ ] multiple conversations seem to blend into one, making the model confused -- implement user parameter?

- [ ] shouldn't respond to just images

### min
- [ ] make terminal output pretty
